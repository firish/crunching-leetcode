560. Subarray Sum Equals K
Medium

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-107 <= k <= 107

// The negtive numbers make this question very tricky
// brute force is easy
// O(n) is tough

// My first solution, all explains prefix sum property (imp)
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count, s, sums = 0, 0, []
        hashmap = defaultdict(int)
        
        # This problem is solved using the prefix funda
        # populate the sums array where i th index has the cummulative sum from i = 0 to current index
        
        # Now, sum of all elements from first index to j is at sums[j]
        # for getting sum of values from a index other than first index, the following property is used
        # sum(nums(i != 0, j)) = sums(i, j) - sums(0, i-1)
        
        # Now, we want to find sub-arrays that add upto a target value k
        # so we want to find arrays where sums[j] - sums[i-1] == k
        # so sums[i-1] = sums[j] - k
        # so traverse through the sums array, where each element is sums[j], subract k, and check
        # if the prefixsum sums[i-1] exists in the hashmap (hashmap has frequency of elements is sums array)
        
        # let first element be 0
        # so if we find target directly in the array (eg k = 5, and element 5 appears in array)
        # we do 5 - 5 and find 0 in hashmap to increase array count by 1
        hashmap[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)): 
            s += nums[i]
            sums.append(s)
            if sums[i] - k in hashmap: count += hashmap[sums[i]-k]
            hashmap[s] += 1
        return count
