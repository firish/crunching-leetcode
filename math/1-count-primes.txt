204. Count Primes
Medium

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

Example 2:
Input: n = 0
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
 
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 5 * 106

// My solution, inspired, ofcourse
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2: return 0
        
        res = 0
        # Sieve of Eratosthene
        # Start from 2 to N
        # Assume all numbers are prime 
        sieve = [0, 0] + ([1]*(n-2))
        
        for num in range(2, int(sqrt(n)+1)):
            if sieve[num]:
                for multiple in range(num*num, n, num):
                    sieve[multiple] = 0
        
        # return number of remaining 1s in sieve (prime numbers)
        return sum(sieve)
